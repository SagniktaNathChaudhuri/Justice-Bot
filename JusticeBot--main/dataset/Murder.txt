MURDER

1. Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860: Provisions Related to Murder
Section 299 – Culpable Homicide
Definition: Culpable homicide is defined as causing death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death.
Classification: Culpable homicide can be classified into two categories:
Culpable Homicide Amounting to Murder (Section 300): This is the more severe category and is considered murder.
Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder (Section 304): This is considered a lesser offense and carries a lighter punishment.
Section 300 – Murder
Definition: A homicide is considered murder if it meets specific criteria such as:

The act is done with the intention of causing death.
The act is done with the intention of causing bodily injury that the offender knows is likely to cause death.
The act is done with the intention of causing bodily injury that is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
The act is done with the knowledge that it is imminently dangerous and will in all probability cause death or bodily injury that is likely to cause death.
Exceptions: Section 300 also outlines exceptions where culpable homicide is not considered murder, such as:

Grave and sudden provocation: If the offender is deprived of the power of self-control due to grave and sudden provocation.
Self-defense: If the act is done in self-defense.
Exceeding private defense: If the right of private defense is exceeded without premeditation.

Section 302 – Punishment for Murder

Section 304 – Punishment for Culpable Homicide Not Amounting to Murder
Punishment: Imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term that may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to a fine. If the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment can extend to imprisonment for up to ten years, or with a fine, or both.
